# Advent of Code 2019 
My Solutions for the Advent of Code 2019
https://adventofcode.com/

As part of advent of code I will be uploading my solutions here, I will also be using a new language each day. 
I am to write down some key learnings and takeways for each set of challenges. 

**Disclaimer**
I haven't done much puzzles in my time, so my code will likely be terrible, and most of my learnings will seem obvious. Also most of these langauges I will have used very little. 

[Day 1 - Python](./day1/)

[Day 2 - Bash](./day2/)
