# Day 2 - Bash

Ok, so doing this in bash was a chore, I haven't really used it much, there was some cool things
but I was trying to do everything in a non-bash way. TDD, extensive use of arrays, stuff that bash
just doesnt really support. In the end though, i got it working? soo.....success. Also i got confused as the test cases ran but my final answer was wrong, turns out i was submitting the entire final array rather than the calculated number it wanted....

In all seriousness actually pre happy I was able to do this.

learnings
