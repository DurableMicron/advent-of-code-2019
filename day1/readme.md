# Day 1 - Python
Started simple with using python, since it's day one there is nothing particular interesting about this challenge.
It is just a simple recursive call, was good to get in the feel for the challenges though.

This code could be a loootttt cleaner, I didn't refactor anything after getting the correct answer.

notes/takeways
* use the examples as test cases
* vscodes tasks functionality is useful
* python is annoying to setup on windows
